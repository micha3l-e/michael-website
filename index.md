# Hey there, I’m Michael.

I’m an **artist** and **digital designer** based in Oklahoma City. I like making things that are thoughtful, useful, and sometimes a little weird.

I'm the **co-founder** of **cow-boys collab**, a two-person art project. we create playful work, upcycled apparel, and handmade trinkets.

I also work as the **Senior Digital Designer** at **Koch Comm**, focusing on websites and interactive media projects.
